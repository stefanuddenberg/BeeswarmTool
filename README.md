# Beeswarm Plotting Tool
This is a web-based tool designed to help you create beeswarm plots â€” a kind of one-dimensional scatterplot that shows every point in a data distribution. You can load your own data in CSV format (using the 'Load CSV' button above the graph), or enter your own comma-separated data (using the 'Data' tab above). You can also customize the appearance of the graph using the various options located in this menu, and then save your graph in either SVG or PNG format using the buttons above the graph. This tool works best on Google Chrome and Firefox.

For more details, please see the following paper: Uddenberg, S., & Scholl, B. J. (under review). Perceptual averaging in visual communication: Ensemble representations in the perception of scientific data in graphs.
